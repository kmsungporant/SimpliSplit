## App Description

SimpliSplit is a mobile app that allows users to scan a restaurant receipt and send a payment request via text message. It makes the process of splitting the bill much easier and faster. The app is built with React Native and Expo. The backend is built with Firebase and Mindee API. The app is currently only available on iOS.

## Motivation

Have you ever been in a situation where you are eating out with a large group of people and the bill comes? You are then forced to split the bill and calculate the tax and tip for each person. Then, you have to send a Venmo request to each person individually. This process is very tedious and time-consuming. SimpliSplit is an app that allows users to scan a restaurant receipt and send a payment request via text message with a single button. It eliminates the need to calculate the tax/tip individually and send Venmo/Zelle requests. Although restaurants have been allowing customers to pay separately, it makes the whole process very tedious for the employee and further complicated.
